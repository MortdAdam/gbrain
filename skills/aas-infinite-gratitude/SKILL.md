# Infinite Gratitude

> **Source**: [sstklen/infinite-gratitude](https://github.com/sstklen/infinite-gratitude)

## Description

A multi-agent research skill designed for parallel research execution. It orchestrates 10 agents to conduct deep research, battle-tested with real case studies.

## When to Use
Use this skill when you need to perform extensive, parallelized research on a topic, leveraging multiple agents to gather and synthesize information more efficiently than a single linear process.

## How to Use

This is an external skill. Please refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/sstklen/infinite-gratitude) for installation and usage instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sstklen/infinite-gratitude
```

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
