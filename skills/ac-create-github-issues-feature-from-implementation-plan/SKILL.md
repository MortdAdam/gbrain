# Create GitHub Issue from Implementation Plan

Create GitHub Issues for the implementation plan at `${file}`.

## Process

1. Analyze plan file to identify phases
2. Check existing issues using `search_issues`
3. Create new issue per phase using `create_issue` or update existing with `update_issue`
4. Use `feature_request.yml` or `chore_request.yml` templates (fallback to default)

## Requirements

- One issue per implementation phase
- Clear, structured titles and descriptions
- Include only changes required by the plan
- Verify against existing issues before creation

## Issue Content

- Title: Phase name from implementation plan
- Description: Phase details, requirements, and context
- Labels: Appropriate for issue type (feature/chore)

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
