# Track Manager

Manage the complete track lifecycle including archiving, restoring, deleting, renaming, and cleaning up orphaned artifacts.

## Use this skill when

- Archiving, restoring, renaming, or deleting Conductor tracks
- Listing track status or cleaning orphaned artifacts
- Managing the track lifecycle across active, completed, and archived states

## Do not use this skill when

- Conductor is not initialized in the repository
- You lack permission to modify track metadata or files
- The task is unrelated to Conductor track management

## Instructions

- Verify `conductor/` structure and required files before proceeding.
- Determine the operation mode from arguments or interactive prompts.
- Confirm destructive actions (delete/cleanup) before applying.
- Update `tracks.md` and metadata consistently.
- If detailed steps are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Backup track data before delete operations.
- Avoid removing archived tracks without explicit approval.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed modes, prompts, and workflows.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
