# Microservices Patterns

Master microservices architecture patterns including service boundaries, inter-service communication, data management, and resilience patterns for building distributed systems.

## Use this skill when

- Decomposing monoliths into microservices
- Designing service boundaries and contracts
- Implementing inter-service communication
- Managing distributed data and transactions
- Building resilient distributed systems
- Implementing service discovery and load balancing
- Designing event-driven architectures

## Do not use this skill when

- The system is small enough for a modular monolith
- You need a quick prototype without distributed complexity
- There is no operational support for distributed systems

## Instructions

1. Identify domain boundaries and ownership for each service.
2. Define contracts, data ownership, and communication patterns.
3. Plan resilience, observability, and deployment strategy.
4. Provide migration steps and operational guardrails.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
