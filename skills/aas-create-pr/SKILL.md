# Alias: create-pr

This skill name is kept for compatibility.

## When to Use
- The user explicitly asks for `create-pr` or refers to the legacy skill name.
- You need to redirect pull request creation work to the canonical `sentry-skills:pr-writer` workflow.
- The task is specifically about writing or updating a pull request rather than general git operations.

Use `sentry-skills:pr-writer` as the canonical skill for creating and editing pull requests.

If invoked via `create-pr`, run the same workflow and conventions documented in `sentry-skills:pr-writer`.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
