# GitHub Skill

Use the `gh` CLI to interact with GitHub. Always specify `--repo owner/repo` when not in a git directory, or use URLs directly.

## When to Use
- When the user asks about GitHub issues, pull requests, workflow runs, or CI failures.
- When you need `gh issue`, `gh pr`, `gh run`, or `gh api` from the command line.

## Pull Requests

Check CI status on a PR:
```bash
gh pr checks 55 --repo owner/repo
```

List recent workflow runs:
```bash
gh run list --repo owner/repo --limit 10
```

View a run and see which steps failed:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo
```

View logs for failed steps only:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo --log-failed
```

### Debugging a CI Failure

Follow this sequence to investigate a failing CI run:

1. **Check PR status** — identify which checks are failing:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks 55 --repo owner/repo
   ```
2. **List recent runs** — find the relevant run ID:
   ```bash
   gh run list --repo owner/repo --limit 10
   ```
3. **View the failed run** — see which jobs and steps failed:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo
   ```
4. **Fetch failure logs** — get the detailed output for failed steps:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo --log-failed
   ```

## API for Advanced Queries

The `gh api` command is useful for accessing data not available through other subcommands.

Get PR with specific fields:
```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/55 --jq '.title, .state, .user.login'
```

## JSON Output

Most commands support `--json` for structured output.  You can use `--jq` to filter:

```bash
gh issue list --repo owner/repo --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'
```

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
