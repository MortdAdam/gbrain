# Tiny Stepping

Drive implementation in the smallest possible meaningful increments, pausing for feedback after each step so the work stays reviewable and easy to course-correct.

## Purpose
- Make the smallest possible meaningful change at each step
- Get user feedback after every step before proceeding
- Reduce risk of going in the wrong direction
- Keep changes reviewable and easy to understand

## Workflow
1. Agree on the next tiny step
2. Implement only that step — nothing more
3. Review uncommitted changes together to verify the step looks right
4. Short check-in: is this the right direction?
5. Commit the step before moving on
6. Agree on the next step
7. Repeat

## Principles
- One concern per step — don't mix unrelated changes
- Each step should be independently understandable
- Prefer compiling/working state after each step
- Don't anticipate future steps — wait for feedback first
- If a step feels too big, split it further

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
