# AI Ready

This skill helps the user install the latest [ai-ready](https://github.com/johnpapa/ai-ready) skill by [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa).

*Why?*: The full ai-ready skill is ~600 lines of detailed instructions that evolve frequently. This wrapper keeps it discoverable here while the source of truth stays in [johnpapa/ai-ready](https://github.com/johnpapa/ai-ready) — always up to date.

## Steps

1. Tell the user to add the skill by running this command inside Copilot CLI:

   ```
   /skills add johnpapa/ai-ready
   ```

   This downloads the latest version of the skill to their personal skills directory. Re-running the command updates to the latest version.

2. Remind the user to review the skill before loading it. They can inspect it with:
   ```bash
   head -20 ~/.copilot/skills/ai-ready/SKILL.md
   ```
3. After the user confirms they've reviewed and installed it, tell them to reload skills with `/skills reload` and then say `make this repo ai-ready`.
4. Do **not** run the command on the user's behalf. The user must run it themselves.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
