The goal is for the tests to cover all lines of code.

Generate a coverage report with:

pytest --cov --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate

If you are checking for coverage of a specific module, you can specify it like this:

pytest --cov=your_module_name --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate

You can also specify specific tests to run, for example:

pytest tests/test_your_module.py --cov=your_module_name --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate

Open the cov_annotate directory to view the annotated source code.
There will be one file per source file. If a file has 100% source coverage, it means all lines are covered by tests, so you do not need to open the file.

For each file that has less than 100% test coverage, find the matching file in cov_annotate and review the file.

If a line starts with a ! (exclamation mark), it means that the line is not covered by tests.
Add tests to cover the missing lines.

Keep running the tests and improving coverage until all lines are covered.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
