This is a guide to add a new language to a Next.js project using next-intl for internationalization,

- For i18n, the application uses next-intl.
- All translations are in the directory `./messages`.
- The UI component is `src/components/language-toggle.tsx`.
- Routing and middleware configuration are handled in:
  - `src/i18n/routing.ts`
  - `src/middleware.ts`

When adding a new language:

- Translate all the content of `en.json` to the new language. The goal is to have all the JSON entries in the new language for a complete translation.
- Add the path in `routing.ts` and `middleware.ts`.
- Add the language to `language-toggle.tsx`.

## Contract

This skill preserves the documented upstream intent while remaining source-grounded. It must inspect required project context, avoid inventing APIs or credentials, and verify any change it makes.

## Output Format

Lead with the actionable result. Report changed files or commands and the verification evidence appropriate to the task. Cite local reference paths instead of dumping entire files.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not apply this skill outside its documented domain when a narrower skill exists.
- Do not fabricate project structure, APIs, credentials, external state, or successful execution.
- Do not skip verification after code, configuration, or workflow changes.
